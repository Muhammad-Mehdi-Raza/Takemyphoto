The problem is, very few of us are good photographers and when we try to capture a moment, than like many others, we take a photograph having no idea about professional photography principles like angle, style, and size of the photo. In simple words, we mess it up!

So here comes our app TakeMyPhoto, to help us all layman. 

It is a camera app that contains sketches of photo poses by professional photographers which will tell about the size and angle of light to take an awesome photo! User will be able to change the opacity of the sketch on the camera screen, to check the object and the style of the sketch.

Advance features of this app will include functionalities like choosing an existing photo from your phone and converting it into a sketch and taking a similar breathtaking photo!

Another feature is providing the connectivity between DSLR and mobile phone to handle DSLR by the mobile phone. Giving automatic sketch suggestions about the poses as the user appears in the camera, will be among the additional features of the app.
